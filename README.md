##END TO END MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT 
# Student Exam Performance Predictor

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Student Exam Performance Predictor** is a machine learning-based web application that predicts a student’s **Maths exam score** based on demographic data, parental education, test preparation, and performance in other subjects (Reading and Writing). This project demonstrates **end-to-end ML workflow**, from data preprocessing and model training to deployment as a Flask web app.

## 🛠 Features

* Predicts Maths scores based on:

  * Gender
  * Race/Ethnicity
  * Parental level of education
  * Lunch type
  * Test preparation course
  * Writing and Reading scores
* Simple and intuitive **web interface** built with Flask
* Real-time predictions
* Input validation for accurate results

## 📊 Dataset

The app uses the **Students Performance Dataset** from Kaggle, which contains:

| Feature                     | Description                        |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Gender                      | Student’s gender (male/female)     |
| Race/Ethnicity              | Group classification (A–E)         |
| Parental Level of Education | Highest parental education level   |
| Lunch                       | Standard or free/reduced           |
| Test Preparation Course     | Completed or none                  |
| Reading Score               | Score out of 100                   |
| Writing Score               | Score out of 100                   |
| Maths Score                 | Score out of 100 (Target variable) |
